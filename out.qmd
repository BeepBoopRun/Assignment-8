I chose to remake the challenger disaster graph. I was able to find the dataset in a repository:

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/92/challenger+usa+space+shuttle+o+ring>

```{r}
#| warning: false
file <- read.csv2("o-ring-erosion-or-blowby.data", header = FALSE, sep=" ", col.names = c("num_O_rings", "num_thermal_distress", "launch_temp", "leak_check_pressure", "temporal_order"))

# converting fahrenheit to celsius
file$launch_temp = (file$launch_temp - 32) * (5/9)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
ggplot(file, aes(x=launch_temp, y=factor(num_thermal_distress)))+
  geom_point(color="darkred", shape=2, position=position_dodge2v(height = 0.1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=-3.33, linetype="twodash", alpha=0.9)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=-1.66, linetype="twodash", alpha=0.9)+
  ggtitle("O-rings damage during previous launches")+
  ylab("O-rings damaged (out of 6)")+
  xlab("Temperature at launch (Â°C)")+
  geom_segment(aes(x = 4.5, y = 1.3, xend = 2, yend = 1.3),
    arrow = arrow(), size=0.05) +
  annotate("text", label = "considered launch temperature",x=4.5, y=1)+
  theme_minimal()
```

Changing y-axis values into objects of class "factor" removes non-integer values, which makes sense, as our data is integer-only. I have not found a satisfactory way to evenly spread the points vertically, the library makes the problem better, but it's still not perfect.
